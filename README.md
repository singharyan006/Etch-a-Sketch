# Etch-a-Sketch 🎨

A browser-based sketchpad built with **HTML**, **CSS (Flexbox)**, and **JavaScript** — inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. Hover over the grid to draw, resize the grid with a button, and enjoy a minimal pixel-art experience.

> 💡 The core logic — from grid generation to hover interactivity and resizing — is implemented entirely in **JavaScript**, making this project a hands-on exercise in DOM manipulation and dynamic UI rendering.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project was to apply and practice key front-end concepts — especially **DOM manipulation using JavaScript**, **Flexbox layout**, and **interactive event handling** — by building a dynamic sketchpad from scratch.

This project was inspired by and built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.
